## How it works üõ†Ô∏è

LinkedIn prevents straightforward web scraping without session cookies and specific headers. This extension modifies HTTP requests made by LinkedIn. It retrieves your connections in bulk while preserving the essential headers and cookie data.

The extension incorporates safeguards against exceeding LinkedIn's rate limits. It retrieves connections in batches of 100 (set as `requestChunksDivider` on background.js)  and introduces random delays (maximum delay in miliseconds is set as `maxDelay`  in background.js) between requests to ensure smooth operation.

## InSight prioritizes user privacy

Importantly, **no data will be stored externally**. The extension does not save any of the gathered data on any external servers.
